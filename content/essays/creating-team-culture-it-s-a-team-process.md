What is team culture and why is it important? What are 
some practical things we can do to develop team cul-
ture and how do we incorporate everyone's input into 
this process? How do we balance being the team we 
are vs. being the team we want to be?


A little known fact about me is that I am a huge sports buff. I've been around 
sports since I was born and started playing shortly there after. I love watching sports; 
I'll watch just about anything. My brain is full of random sports facts that typically 
aren't useful for anything except maybe trivia. I also keep up with sports stats like 
team and player efficiency rating- yes I know, I'm THAT person. Some teams I was 
obsessed with and loved watching play have some pretty awesome nicknames. The 
Los Angeles Lakers in the early 80s were known as Showtime, the Detroit Pistons 
took on the Bad Boy persona, the Pittsburgh Steelers in the early 70's had the Steel 
Curtain defense, and the University of Miami football program is simply known as 
The U. These names were more than fun, catchy nicknames. These names were also 
these teams' identities. The Showtime Lakers were known for exciting, run-and-gun 
offense. The Bad Boys were physically aggressive and relentless on defense, same as 
the Steel Curtain. The U was a culture of swagger made up of big time personalities 
with lots of attitude and never shied away from trash talk. All teams may not have 
catchy nicknames, but all teams have a unique identity or a team culture. 
When we think of culture, we think about the attitudes and behaviors that may characterize 
a particular group of people. So team culture is the attitudes and behaviors of a team. This 
includes all the rituals, habits, routines, systems and expectations teams have in place to 
achieve a common goal. **The most important thing to remember about team culture is 
the concept of team.** 
A positive team experience comes from each member of the team buying in or believing 
in your teams' values and goals that each member helps decide. Good team culture comes 
from every member working together, communicating effectively and being supportive of 
one another. Support from teammates is key! Support is what gives people the confidence to 
open up and trust each other. You want people to be willing to open up when times are good 
and also when things may be tough or challenging. This includes on or off the field issues. 
I real y like this topic because I definitely identify as a true team player. I strive to be flexible, 
willing to help, but most importantly, be supportive. As a team player, I completely believe 
and trust my teams' systems. No matter what other roles I may take on within the team, I 
always want being the best teammate possible to be my first role. 
My club team, Atlanta Ozone, likes to say, _"Be generous with your teammates." _Being generous 
with your teammates means being willing to support and listen to them. Taking the time to 
build relationships with your teammates. Going the extra mile to make sure we remember 
we are a team and not just a bunch of individuals. I have a couple of practical things you can 
do and other takeaways to help develop team culture. I will also share perspectives on team 
culture from some of the high school students I coach. 
**Establishing Team Culture**
Ok so you have just selected your team for the upcoming season. What now? After selecting 
your team, the next best thing to do is to have a team meeting. Plan ahead and select a time 
when a majority of your team can join. A good way to get everybody comfortable and willing to 
open up is with some ice breaker games. I used to be a person who hated playing ice breakers, 
but now I love them. It's a good way to see if there are people that you share commonalities 
with. Having these connections helps people feel closer to one another and more willing to 
open up and share. 
Something Ozone has been doing at our preseason meetings is asking for buzz words related 
to how we want to define our team. We use a white board and ask for everyone to participate 
by writing down a word or a phrase on how they want to define the team's identity. Examples 
of words we wrote down: present, gritty defense, supportive, trust, swagger, motivating, 
spirited, welcoming, balanced, family, and fun. After everyone has written down a couple or 
words or phrases, everyone gets some sticky notes and puts them around the buzzwords that 
they identify with. The words with the most sticky notes beside them will be what the team 
values the most. Our top words included family, balanced, competitive and supportive. I like 
this way of coming up with team values because it is definitely a team effort, everybody has 
an input. It also helps to narrow down some attainable team goals based on the values the 
team just decided on. For example, Ozone wants to be known as a competitive team. A goal 
![](/images/creating-team-culture-it-s-a-team-process-post-3_1.jpg)
we came up with based off of that value was making semis at each tournament we competed 
at. Remember, these team goals should be decided together as a team. You'll get more buy-in 
when everybody starts on the same page. 
**Team Buy-In**
The team is set, values have been established and goals have been made. All of this sounds 
good on paper, but how do you get everyone to believe in them? You are about to spend a 
tremendous amount of time together as a team. Practice, workouts, tournaments, that is 
a ton of time together! Before you get into your season, make sure there are planned team 
activities. These activities can involve ultimate, but make sure there are non-frisbee activities 
as well. Fun activities don't have to take up too much extra time. 
My team will usually have 
lunch post practice or grab 
dinner together at tournaments. 
Other activities we like include 
watching movies or streaming 
ultimate games, getting food 
together, or going to support 
other local sports teams. Spend 
time with your teammates, be 
flexible and get to know them! 
When your team starts to feel 
like family, you are establishing 
good team culture. 
Another way to instill team 
buy-in is by creating team  Ozone celebrates an upset win over Riot during Quarters at the 2017

phrase that can fire up your 
team, but also reminds you of team values is huge! My high school kids last year were a roster 
of 23, which lead to the call and response cheer, "How strong are we? 23!" Not only was this 
a cheer to bring the sideline energy up, it also reminds them that the team is made up of 23 
individuals, not just a few players. On Ozone we like to say, "Eat and Stay Hungry." It fires us 
up, but it's a reminder that we aren't satisfied until we reach our goals. Some words or cheers 
can also come from inside jokes or funny stories shared by the team. Ozone gets really hyped 
talking about carrots...don't ask.
**Team We Are Vs. Team We Want To Be**
Turnover on a team from year to year is bound to happen. Sometimes you lose one player, 
sometimes a large graduating class. Sometimes you may have issues during the season that 
could have a major impact on the team. Team culture may change with these situations, 
for better or for worse. It is important to have regular check-ins with the team to make sure 
team values and goals are still being carried out. I have seen these check-ins happen as a 
whole team, 1 on 1 or within smaller groups like buddy groups or pods. What feedback are 
you getting from players? You could also be getting feedback from other teams. Listen! Are 
you getting away from team values? Are you making sure everyone feels included? Are you 
connecting with newer players? Take all this feedback into account and make the necessary 
changes to preserve team culture. 
**Final Takeaways**

1. Team culture is how your team identifies. Are you competitive? Spirited? Just playing 
   for fun? 
2. How your team identifies and what your team values should be decided as a team. 
   Everybody's input should be taken into account. Remember, support is important!
3. Team bonding. Your team is your family. Get to know each other and have fun together. 
4. Regular team check-ins are a good thing. How's the team culture? Are we achieving 
   our goals? Are we practicing our team values? Listen to feedback and make changes if 
   necessary. Remember this is a team and everyone should feel supported and valued. 
   Everyone should feel included!
   In addition to playing on Ozone, I coach the women's varsity ultimate team at Paideia. 
   Paideia Groove is a well established program. Groove has a phenomenal team culture; the best 
   word to describe it is family. I asked a couple of my kids how they defined the team culture 
   on Groove. I wanted to share some of their thoughts and ideas on Groove's team culture.
   _"We were able to recognize each other's strengths and have a good time together 
   because of it." _
   _"Commitment was one of the biggest defining things."_
   _"The balance between goofiness and focus. There are leaders on the team that are 
   weird in an awesome way and that became part of the culture. It's cool when the 
   leadership can be fun too."_
   _"Good balance of competition and support within the team. I strived to work hard 
   because I saw my teammates working hard. I was friends with my teammates so it 
   wasn't hard to want to work and cheer for them." _
   Creating team culture requires input and effort from everyone on the team. And when 
   there is commitment and buy-in to team values and goals, it is easy for everybody to feel 
   welcomed and supported. It is easy for everybody to recognize and believe in their team's 
   culture. So even if your team doesn't have a catchy nickname, your team should be able to 
   come up with an identity and own it.
